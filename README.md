# Voidhome

Downloads, setup help and bug reports for Voidhome, a hardcore co-op skyblock
mod for Minecraft Java 26.3 (Fabric).

Voidhome used to be called Ultimate Skyblock. The files, the installer and the
in-game name still say Ultimate Skyblock until the next release.

I made it to play with two friends, so it is balanced for 2 or 3 players. Solo
works, it is just slower.

**[Download the latest release](https://github.com/TorMartin-ops/voidhome-downloads/releases/latest)** |
**[Report a bug or give feedback](https://github.com/TorMartin-ops/voidhome-downloads/issues/new/choose)**

The newest mod jar is also on
[CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ultimate-skyblock).

## Install

Pick one:

- **Windows with the normal Minecraft Launcher:** download the `-client.zip`,
  extract it, close Minecraft and the launcher, then run `Install.bat`.
- **Modrinth App or Prism Launcher (Windows, macOS, Linux):** download the
  `.mrpack` and import it as a new instance. Use Java 25.
- **You already have Fabric:** put the release JAR and Fabric API for 26.3 in
  your mods folder. I test with Fabric Loader 0.19.5 and Java 25.

Then make a new world with **World Type: Skyblock**, structures on, and
**Hardcore** if you want it the way it is meant to be played. Everyone you play
with needs the same version of the mod.

## What is in it

- You start on a tiny island with one ice, one lava bucket, an oak tree and a
  sapling. If you lose the lava the run can be over.
- The world still has real biomes, there is just no ground. There are small
  islets to find, places where structure mobs spawn, floating Nether
  structures, and the End.
- The block under your cobblestone generator decides which ore it makes.
  Finishing quests makes the crew's generators faster.
- Five skills: Mining, Woodcutting, Farming, Angling and Slaying.
- Void fishing with its own fish, bait, salvage and records.
- Visitors with names who dock at a Hitching Post and bring bounties.
- Hardcore with friends: the dead can be brought back, but it costs. When
  everyone is dead you start a new run.
- Silk Touch can move spawners, trial spawners too.
- AFK farms are fine. Nothing punishes you for them by default.

## The mods in the pack

The pack has ten mod files: Ultimate Skyblock, Fabric API, Sodium, Lithium,
FerriteCore, ImmediatelyFast, Entity Culling, AppleSkin, Jade and Shulker Box
Tooltip. You only need the first two. The other eight are there for
performance and for showing useful info.

Minecraft will say you have more than ten mods. That is normal, Fabric API
counts as a lot of small ones.

## Keys

- `K` opens Skills
- Tap `G` for a perk action
- Hold `G` for 0.6 seconds for the level 10 power

`/skyblock guide` gives you the guide book again, `/skyblock notes` explains
your perks and `/skyblock rewards` shows rewards the team has not picked yet.
You can change the keys in Minecraft's controls.

## Feedback

This is a playtest and I change things based on what people tell me. Bugs,
crashes and exploits are useful, and so is "this part was boring" or "I did
not understand what to do here".

When you report something, please say which version, your OS, how many you
were and roughly how long you had played. For bugs, the steps to make it
happen again and the part of the log that matters.

Do not upload launcher account files, tokens or your whole game folder.

It has not been played much on macOS, so reports from Mac players are extra
welcome. 2.8.5 only changed how the mod is packaged and licensed, the gameplay
is the same as 2.8.4.
